          <h2> About Me</h2>
          <p>Hi! Thanks for visiting my page.  I have worked in many sectors over the years most notably as an estate agent for over ten years!
            I have vast experience in customer sales and most importantly understanding what it is a client wants in order to provide the best service which I believe will translate well in to Web Development.
            In my spare time I like to keep fit by running the occasional half marathon as well as days out in the Peak District.
